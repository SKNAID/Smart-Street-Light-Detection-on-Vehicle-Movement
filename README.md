# Smart-Street-Light-Detection-on-Vehicle-Movement
Smart Street Light Detection System: This project uses an Arduino along with PIR and IR sensors to detect vehicle movement and automatically control street lights. The system turns the light on for 1 second(could be customized) when a vehicle is detected and off when no movement is detected, optimizing energy use and enhancing street safety.
